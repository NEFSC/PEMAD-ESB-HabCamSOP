#### Collecting Calibration Data {#sec-6wk-collecting-data}

**1. Checkerboard Target Data Collection:**

* **Common Area Positioning:** Ensure the entire checkerboard is placed in the overlap zone (common area) between the left and right cameras' fields of view so it appears fully on both cameras.

<div align="center">
  <img width="515" height="123" alt="Checkerboard Common Area View" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be5faafa-43ce-45de-9d7a-ed6db7d5ab3e" />
  <p><i>Checkerboard Positioned Within the Overlapping Common Viewing Area</i></p>
</div>

<br>

* **Grid Coverage:** Divide the common viewing area into 9 equal regions and take photos in all 9 regions to ensure full spatial coverage.

<div align="center">
  <img width="233" height="101" alt="Region Grid Overlay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/575fc675-9594-4792-a14a-02add361cc14" />
  <p><i>9-Region Division Grid Across Common Field of View</i></p>
</div>

<br>

* **Glare & Tilting:** Avoid direct strobe glare on the board (glare images will be rejected by estimation software). Tilting the board slightly is preferred over lying flat to minimize glare.
* **Altitude & Angle Sampling:** Capture images across 2–3 different vehicle altitudes and multiple angles (both flat and tilted).

<div align="center">

  <p><i>Figure 1: Acceptable Checkerboard Sample Images Across Angles and Altitudes from the 2015 Calibration (Best)</i></p>
</div>

<br>

**2. Scallop Target Data Collection:**

* **Placement:** Lay the scallop target board flat on the bottom of the dunk tank for accurate altimeter reference. Lower and raise the vehicle using the overhead crane.

<div align="center">
  <img width="1600" height="1200" alt="Scallop Shell Target Board" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff6101d-0e0a-4711-bbf8-8d25fda95d35" />
  <p><i>Physical Scallop Calibration Target Board with Known Shell Heights</i></p>
</div>

<br>

* **Field-of-View Distribution:** Divide the full field of view into 9 regions. Capture images with the target in 5 regions of the left field of view and 2 regions at the far right of the right field of view (or 5 right / 2 far left).

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

* **Varied Sampling:** Take photos at 2–3 distinct altitudes and varying tilt angles.

<br>

#### Evaluation Criteria & Processing Iterations {#sec-6wk-evaluation-criteria}

**Criteria for a Successful Calibration:**

1. **Visual Integrity:** Processed images must be undistorted with minimal black edge bands (black border pixels must represent &lt; 5% of total image pixels).

<div align="center">
  <table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <img width="1600" height="602" alt="Bad Calibration Distortion" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa5a1da3-b19b-4dd2-8907-3786d6307a3d" />
        <br>
        <b>Bad Calibration: Heavy Distortion & Black Edge Bands (>10%)</b>

        <br>
        <b>Good Calibration: Minimal Edge Distortion (<5% Black Pixels)</b>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br>

2. **Stereo Coverage Rate:** Successful stereo altitude estimates must be generated for &gt; 95% of total captured images.
3. **Measurement Accuracy:** Estimated scallop shell lengths (calculated via stereo altitude) must fall within &plusmn;3% of true physical measurements.

<br>

**Step-by-Step Parameter Estimation Workflow:**
1. Estimate initial calibration parameters from selected checkerboard images.
2. Process all scallop target images using the candidate calibration parameters.
3. Inspect processed output images visually for optical distortion.
4. Calculate the percentage of black edge pixels (&lt; 5% threshold).
5. Determine the percentage of total images receiving valid stereo altitude estimates.
6. Annotate the scallop target board images in numbered sequence (1 through 9).

<div align="center">
  <img width="230" height="173" alt="Numbered Scallop Annotation Sequence" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e527551-f924-4c83-af72-cea6627f152f" />
  <p><i>Required Numbered Sequence (1–9) for Scallop Target Board Annotations</i></p>
</div>


7. Calculate average percentage bias in estimated scallop shell height compared to ground truth.
8. Iterate image selection and parameter fitting until all three success criteria are satisfied.

### The 2018 Experiment {#sec-6wk-2018-experiment}

#### Rationale

The paired tows of NEFSC Habcam, NEFSC dredge, and VIMS dredge were conducted at the same time at 19 overlapping stations in Elephant Trunk (ET) in 2018 (Figure 1). These pair tows were designed to study the dredge filling issue at high density area and the difference between 10 minutes and 15 minutes tows.

<div align="center">
  <img width="720" height="720" alt="Figure 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c8d71e-e2c8-4b13-9fdb-df2834329beb" />
  <p><i>Figure 1. The paired tow locations for NEFSC Habcam, NEFSC dredge, and VIMS dredge survey, along with the locations for the entire VIMS dredge and WHOI Habcam survey in ET (the right gray polygon is ET-Open and the left gray polygon is ET-Flex) in 2018.</i></p>
</div>


However, a problem for the NEFSC Habcam data emerged when analyzing the paired tow data - the mean scallop shell height collected by NEFSC Habcam estimated using the altimeter altitudes (122mm in ET-Open and 119mm in ET-Flex) was 13-16% higher than the mean scallop shell height collected by the NEFSC dredge (108mm in ET-Open and 103mm in ET-Flex; Figure 2). The shell height distributions from the NEFSC dredge and Habcam survey should be nearly identical since they were surveying overlapping locations and there is only one dominant cohort in ET.

The WHOI Habcam data have a similar problem compared to the VIMS dredge data, the mean shell height estimated using stereo altitudes was 6-8% higher (Figure 2). Even though the two surveys were not completely overlapped (Figure 1), a 6-8% difference in mean shell height is not expected in ET. If the altitudes from the Habcam data are accurate, the comparison of dredge and Habcam data in areas with only a single cohort are expected to be similar to Figure 3.

<div align="center">
  <img width="1100" height="500" alt="Figure 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e419861-dcc7-4df9-be6a-c5304e8d205a" />
  <p><i>Figure 2. Shell height frequencies, the number of shells measured, and mean shell height from multiple surveys in ET in 2018.</i></p>
</div>


<div align="center">
  <img width="650" height="500" alt="Figure 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd735580-b3ff-4514-901a-7652335bf9ca" />
  <p><i>Figure 3. Shell height frequencies, the number of shells measured, and mean shell height from VIMS dredge and CFF Habcam survey (altimeter altitude) in the Nantucket Light Ship South Deep area in 2018.</i></p>
</div>


Because the NEFSC Habcam altimeter was not collecting accurate altitudes, the usefulness of stereo altitudes was explored. However, of 119,645 NEFSC Habcam images annotated in 2018, only 3,627 images have stereo altitudes. The estimated stereo altitudes are either close to the altimeter altitudes or centered at 0.93 meters, which means that the stereo altitudes were estimated poorly and also biased (Figure 4).

<div align="center">
  <img width="720" height="720" alt="Figure 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7b2ddb-1e10-4395-9f0e-0bc37f945a23" />
  <p><i>Figure 4. Comparison of altimeter and stereo altitudes for NEFSC Habcam data (annotated images) in 2018. Red line is a one to one line.</i></p>
</div>


The comparison between Habcam and dredge survey shell heights were further examined from 2011 to 2018 for all areas surveyed to see if this is a single year problem or it persists over years. The list of the type of altitudes (and field of view calculations) used to estimate scallop shell heights for the Habcam data for each year is below (Burton Shank personal comm.):

* 2019 stereo altitudes only.
* 2018 sonar altitudes only.
* 2017 sonar altitudes only; 386 stereo altitudes in database.
* 2016 stereo altitudes for 36,844 images of 97,266 images; sonar for the rest.
* 2015 sonar altitudes only; no direct FOV calculation, had to use altitude-based second-order polygon model; should fix this in the future.
* 2014 sonar altitudes only. Direct FOV calculation for all except 723 images with FOV filled in with polygon model.
* 2011 to 2013 working on this.

The problem of altitudes for the NEFSC Habcam started in 2017. There are no accurate altitudes recorded or estimated for 2017 and 2018 NEFSC Habcam data. The problem is still not resolved to this date. This forced us to use stereo altitudes for the 2019 data. However, even though the bias of shell heights calculated using stereo altitudes are less than 5% in 2019, it is still not as good as the altimeter altitudes if the altimeter is working properly (Figure 3) because the stereo altitudes are estimates and estimates have errors.

#### Goals

1. Find a method to examine the accuracy of the stereo altitudes estimated from the calibration - at least one set of altitude needs to be accurate, if not both.
2. Identify a method to correct the 2017 and 2018 NEFSC Habcam data.

#### Experiment Design

1. Three targets were made to explore the accuracy of the stereo altitudes, one with scallop shells and two with plastic disks to represent smaller scallops shell heights.

<div align="center">
  <table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img width="1600" height="1200" alt="Figure 5C" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4525fa0b-a3e5-4324-9ab4-eb160206cf2f" /></td>
      <td align="center"><img width="1047" height="785" alt="Figure 5B" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54942b51-a05a-4d7c-8bdc-2ab3d2c47d9d" /></td>
      <td align="center"><img width="1600" height="1200" alt="Figure 5A" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e05d22be-cb6c-4f58-b544-7d554e4acdd5" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

2. Images of the 3 targets were taken during the 2018 post-cruise calibration at 2 different altitudes and 5 different locations of the left field of view.

<div align="center">
  <img width="233" height="101" alt="Target Position Grid" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c85e44-d7ec-47fb-bc74-706a8e07c6a6" />
</div>

3. For each target, 2 images at each location and altitude were processed and annotated, resulting in a total of 64 images analyzed.
4. The 64 selected target images were processed using the calibration estimated using the checkerboard images taken during the experiment (2018 post-cruise calibration, 20181102), as well as calibrations from the past:
   * 2018 post-cruise calibration (20181102)
   * 2018 pre-cruise calibration (20180507)
   * 2018 during-cruise calibration (20180527)
   * 2017 pre-cruise calibration (20170501)
   * 2015 post-cruise calibration (20150801)
   * 2015 pre-cruise calibration (20150501)
5. Each of the 64 target images was processed 6 times (using the above 6 calibrations). All of these processed images were annotated by two annotators.
6. The scallop shell heights (or disk sizes) estimated using the stereo altitudes were compared to their true sizes and percent biases were calculated using the following equation:

$$\% \text{Bias} = \frac{\text{Estimated Size} - \text{True Size}}{\text{True Size}} \times 100\%$$

7. The percent biases were compared by calibrations, annotators, scallop or disk sizes, 3 targets, 2 altitudes, and 5 locations in the field of view.
8. Once the best calibration is identified, biased measurements from other calibrations were reestimated using the stereo altitudes from the best calibration to check if biased measurements can simply be corrected by reprocessing.
9. To test the sensitivity of checkerboard images, 200 calibrations were estimated from randomly selected checkerboard images iteratively 200 times.

#### Results

1. Below is the summary table of the number of images that have stereo altitude estimated:

<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Calibration</th>
      <th># of images with stereo estimates</th>
      <th>Percent with stereo estimates</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>2018 post-cruise (20181102)</td><td>64</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2018 pre-cruise (20180507)</td><td>14</td><td>22%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2018 during-cruise (20180527)</td><td>41</td><td>64%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2017 pre-cruise (20170501)</td><td>25</td><td>39%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2015 post-cruise (20150801)</td><td>61</td><td>95%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2015 pre-cruise (20150501)</td><td>53</td><td>83%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

2. There are significant differences in percent biases by calibration. Mean bias ranged from +14% (2018 pre-cruise) down to -2% (2015 post-cruise; Figure 5).

<div align="center">
  <img width="1000" height="1000" alt="Figure 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94e75c09-3d27-43c4-ba10-4cac9b95bd83" />
  <p><i>Figure 5. Density plot of percent biases from all measurements (gray bars) and measurements by calibrations. Dash lines are the mean percent bias by calibrations.</i></p>
</div>

<br>

3. The best calibration is the 2015 post-cruise calibration (20150801) - it estimated 95% of stereo altitudes with a mean bias of -2%. Reprocessing reduced mean percent biases to within &plusmn;3% (Figure 6).

<div align="center">
  <img width="1000" height="1000" alt="Figure 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30ad477b-209e-4541-9418-9b14dcb48920" />
  <p><i>Figure 6. Density plot of percent biases reestimated using stereo altitudes from the 2015 post-cruise calibration (20150801).</i></p>
</div>

<br>

4. Target locations in the field of view caused slight differences in bias (e.g., top-right corner was slightly more biased; Figure 7).

<div align="center">
  <img width="1000" height="1000" alt="Figure 7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69338334-145b-4cb8-bd2d-cbac618352c3" />
  <p><i>Figure 7. Density plot of percent biases by target locations in FOV and altitudes (1.92m and 2.41m).</i></p>
</div>

<br>

5. The 200 calibrations estimated from randomly selected checkerboard images show significant variance in performance, ranging between &plusmn;20% bias (Figure 8).

<div align="center">
  <img width="1310" height="763" alt="Figure 8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77861a0f-dc4e-4b4f-a55c-6464493f3477" />
  <p><i>Figure 8. Density plot of percent biases across 200 random checkerboard calibration iterations.</i></p>
</div>

<br>

#### Conclusions

1. Calibration performance varies dramatically; thorough validation is required before official deployment.
2. The 2015 post-cruise calibration (20150801) is the best performing calibration tested.
3. Calibration accuracy is sensitive to the specific checkerboard images chosen rather than minor camera hardware changes over time.
4. Biased measurements from bad calibrations can be corrected by reprocessing images with a validated calibration model without needing full re-annotation.
